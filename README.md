## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Explore and visualize survival data from the Titanic dataset
- Identify patterns based on **gender**, **class**, **age**, **family size**, and **embarked location**
- Handle and visualize missing data

---

## 📊 Visualizations & Insights

### 1. **Survival Count**
- Visualized total number of passengers who **survived** vs those who **did not** using a `countplot`.

### 2. **Gender Distribution**
- Number of **male vs female** passengers.

### 3. **Survival by Gender**
- Count of **survived vs not survived**, separated by **gender**.

### 4. **Passenger Class Distribution**
- Total number of passengers in **1st, 2nd, and 3rd class**.

### 5. **Survival by Class**
- Survival analysis in **each class category**.

### 6. **Age Distribution**
- Visualized using a `histplot` to understand the distribution of passengers’ **ages**.

### 7. **Family Members Onboard**
- Number of family members (siblings/spouse and parents/children) visualized to study the impact on survival chances.

### 8. **Embarked Location**
- Count of passengers based on the **port of embarkation** (`C`, `Q`, `S`).

### 9. **Missing Data Heatmap**
- Used a `heatmap` to show **missing values** in the dataset.

## 🧼 Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values

Converted categorical values to numeric (if needed)

Cleaned and prepared the dataset for visualization
---
## 📁 Dataset Source
- The Titanic dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle.
---

## 💡 Conclusion
- This project provides a visual perspective on the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic, highlighting how different features like gender, class, and age influenced outcomes. It also showcases effective data visualization practices using Python.
---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add interactive dashboards using Plotly or Dash

- Perform machine learning prediction on survival

- Create grouped bar plots for deeper comparisons
